This project is focused on some contents of Machine Learning in HUFS.

Mainly, this covers several python tools, 
from widely-using numpy pandas matplotlib to scikit-learn, etc.

To begin from the ground, this will firstly handle major built-in stuffs.

Next will be python's well-known libraries, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, ...
